## Future Project Plan üîÆ

Testing how good the Movie Recommender is :

1. Build a new feature that exhibits diversity across genres, casting choices, and production styles.
2. An email to be sent to users with the list of movies recommended to them
3. The user accounts can keep a record of the feedback given by them (liked, disliked or yet to watch).


Note: Our system can be virtually tested through Github Actions inbuilt feature of build and test queries using python.

Make sure you taste your own medicine first and take into account other peoples familiarity with the system before you design your tests.

## Working üì±

Below working displays the system also evaluates movie attributes such as genre, cast, director, and user-generated reviews. 
- By combining these user-specific data and film characteristics, the recommender system employs machine learning to generate tailored movie recommendations.
- This enables users to discover new films that align with their individual tastes, making the movie-watching experience more enjoyable and engaging.
- The users can directly watch the trailer of any movie recommended to them. 
- Furthermore, recommender systems often employ a feedback loop, where users' interactions and feedback help refine the recommendations over time, ensuring that the suggestions remain relevant.
- The users can register and log in to their accounts to keep a history of the movies recommended for them.

## *Contributions and Commit Tracking*
   - *Add a Contribution Guide*: Ensure CONTRIBUTING.md details coding standards, branch naming conventions, and commit message guidelines. Encourage regular commits from all team members, noting that contributions should be balanced across the team.
   - *Add Evidence of Team Activity*: In CONTRIBUTING.md or a dedicated section, highlight contributions by each team member. You can create a table summarizing commit counts and closed issues per contributor.

## *Issue Tracking*
   - *Document Issue Workflow*: Describe your process for opening, discussing, and resolving issues. This could be a section in CONTRIBUTING.md or README.md to explain the typical workflow for issue creation and resolution, including feedback loops.
   - *Issue Labels and Templates*: Add templates for common issues (bug, feature request, etc.), with clear labels to streamline issue reporting.

## *Comprehensive Documentation*
   - *Class/Function Descriptions*: In code files, ensure each class and function has a short docstring explaining its purpose and parameters. Generate documentation using tools like Sphinx or MkDocs if possible and link it in the README.
   - *Use Case Tutorials*: Add a "Getting Started" or "Usage" section in README.md or a docs folder, with examples showing:
      - *Use Case 1*: Setting up and using the recommendation engine for new users.
      - *Use Case 2*: Submitting feedback (like, dislike, yet to watch) and understanding its impact on future recommendations.
      - *Use Case 3*: Setting up weekly email recommendations based on viewing history.
   - *Overview and Motivation*: In README.md, add a brief project motivation explaining why the system was built and how it solves user pain points (e.g., eliminating indecision in choosing movies).

## *Video and Visuals*
   - *Short Demo Video*: Create a 1-2 minute video that demonstrates how a new user registers, receives recommendations, submits feedback, and views top movies. Host the video on GitHub or a video platform and link it in the README.
   - *Screenshots*: Add screenshots in README.md or in a docs/screenshots folder, showing key features like the Top 10 Movies section, feedback options, and weekly email setup.

## *Version Control and Release Cycle*
   - *Git Branching and Releases*: In CONTRIBUTING.md, explain your branching strategy (e.g., main, dev, feature branches) and add guidelines for frequent merges and short release cycles.
   - *CHANGELOG.md*: Add a CHANGELOG.md to track updates, new features, and bug fixes in each release.

## *Testing Documentation*
   - *Test Case Coverage*: In README.md or a TESTING.md file, summarize the scope of tests, including:
      - *Types of Tests*: Valid/invalid input handling, duplicate removal, email recommendation logic, feedback recording.
      - *Execution*: Describe automated testing with GitHub Actions (e.g., tests triggered on every commit).
   - *Handling Failing Cases*: In the test documentation, explain how failing test cases are handled, including opening issues and tracking resolutions.

## *Repository Configuration Files*
   - *GitHub Actions for Testing*: Ensure GitHub Actions configurations are included in .github/workflows, with a description in the README.
   - *Config Files*: Add configuration files like .gitignore, black, and pylint for code formatting and linting, and include explanations in the README.

## *Additional Files for Open Source Projects*
   - *INSTALL.md*: Create INSTALL.md to explain setup instructions, required Python packages, and dependencies.
   - *CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md*: Outline expected behavior and collaboration guidelines in CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md.
   - *LICENSE.md*: Confirm LICENSE.md is clearly listed as MIT, allowing users to understand their rights.

## *Badges for Code Quality and Analysis*
   - *Add Badges in README*: Include badges for:
      - *Code Coverage* (e.g., Codecov)
      - *Style Checkers* (e.g., Black)
      - *Build Status* (e.g., GitHub Actions)
      - *Other Analysis Tools* like syntax checkers or linters

## *Digital Object Identifier (DOI)*
   - *Zenodo DOI Badge*: Consider registering your project on Zenodo to obtain a DOI for easy referencing and sharing. This badge can be added to the README to improve the project‚Äôs credibility.
