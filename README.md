## Testing

  We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:

  ```
  python run -m pytest test/
  ```
  (OR)
  ```
  python -m pytest test/
  ```

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```

## Usage
We have tried to make this application (bot) as easy as possible. You can use this bot to manage and track you daily expenses and not worry about loosing track of your expenses. As we also have given in a functionality of graphing and plotting and history of expenses, it becomes easy for the user to track expenses.
To make your experience even better, we have added User Tutorials for all the basic operations you can perform with DollarBot!!
