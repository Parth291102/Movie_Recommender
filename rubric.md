### &nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements in Project 2

We improved and modernized the functionality and user experience of the movie recommendation system to be more visually appealing and intuitive. Key improvements include:

- **Netflix-Themed Interface**: A modern, familiar design makes navigation intuitive and attractive.
- **OMDb API Integration**: Users can now access essential movie details, like genre, IMDb ratings, and posters, enriching the recommendation experience.
- **CORS Issue Resolution**: Implemented "access-control-allow-origin" headers to ensure cross-origin resource sharing compatibility.
