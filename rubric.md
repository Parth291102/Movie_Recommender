### &nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements in Project 2

We have significantly enhanced the functionality, personalization, and user engagement features of the movie recommendation system. Key improvements include:

**Personalized Email Recommendations:** Users can now receive weekly email recommendations tailored to their movie-watching preferences, keeping them engaged with fresh content every week.

**User Feedback System:** Added options for users to provide feedback (Like, Dislike, Yet to Watch) on each recommended movie, helping the system improve future recommendations based on user preferences.

**Enhanced Top 10 Movies Section:** A new “Top 10 Movies” section displays the most relevant movie recommendations based on user data, making it easy for users to discover popular and highly rated options.

**History Tracking:** Users can view their recommendation history, allowing them to revisit previously suggested movies and track their watching habits over time.

**Plot-Based Recommendation System:** Integrated a plot-based recommendation feature, which analyzes plot-related data to further refine and personalize movie suggestions.

**Automated Testing and CI Integration:** Implemented GitHub Actions for continuous integration, with comprehensive test coverage for backend and frontend functionalities to maintain system reliability and performance with every new code push.
